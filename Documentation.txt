First created a directory "kernel_2d_memcpy".
Created a c file "kernel_2d_memcpy" to implememt the syscall and then created a Makefile.
Added the syscall number 451, syscall name("kernel_2d_memcpy") and sys_kernel_2d_memcpy in the sycall_64.tbl table inside the kernel folder.
Added the syscall name ("kernel_2d_memcp/") to line number 1103 of the kernel Makefile.
Created the diff.patch by initializing a git repo inside the orignal kernel.
Compiled the custom kernel(kernel with the syscall) with the following commands :-

make -j4
make modules_install
cp -v arch/x86/boot/bzImage boot/vmlinuz-linuxMySyscall
mkinitcpio -k 5.19.8 -g /boot.initramfs-linuxMySyscall.img
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Then rebooted the system to use the custom kernel.
Created a test.c to test the syscall.
The initial sourceMatrix was {{1.0,2.0,3.0},{4.0,5.0,6.0},{7.0,8.0,9.0},{10.0,11.0,12.0}}
The initial destinationMatrix was {{1.0,1.0,2.0},{9.0,9.0,6.0},{8.0,8.0,9.0},{10.0,21.0,12.0}}.
After using syscall(kernel_2d_memcpy,sourceMatrix,destinationMatrix,4,3), the destinationMatrix became a copy of the sourceMatrix and was printed.
